						<h5 class="card-title text-dark">Who I Am</h5>
						<p></p>
						<p>I am a current Junior, intending on graduating in May 2021.</p>
						<p>My passion is building beautiful things from makefiles
							to compilers to servers or even mobile applications. In university, I'm learning the
							complexity behind computers and
							computer networks. On my own, however, is where I do a
							large portion of my learning. I'm currently learning how to quickly make apps for
							future hackathons using Google's SDK, Flutter. I'm building a compiler proper in my Compilers and Language Design course, and I'm on the executive board for CS For Good, a
							club that organizes several
							non-profit projects to serve the needs of the community.</p>
						<p>When I'm not teaching myself how to become a better programmer, you
							can usually find me at the climbing wall or in the weight-room. Or maybe
							on South Quad with a couple of friends. Maybe hammocking, perhaps slacklining, or even
							messing with some soccer, football,
							or volleyball - really just anything of that nature.</p>

						<p>I am actively searching for a software engineering internship for the Summer of 2020 to

							am open to moving to <b>any</b> location, though I am more attracted to the fast-paced
							environments provided by California, Seattle, and New York.</p>
						<p>The technologies I would like to work with include machine learning, full-stack development,

						<h5 class="card-title text-dark">Summer 2019 - Cerenovus Product Management Intern</h5>
						<p>This summer of 2019 I spent in Miramar, FL working for a medical device company (Cerenovus)
							in Johnson & Johnson's Family of Companies. My role, as a Product Management Intern, can be
							split into two separate functional groups.
						</p>
						<div class="container">
							<p><b>Technical:</b> The facility, which was split as a manufacturing
								site and as an office space, served as a great opportunity to examine manufacturing
								processes
								and devise how they can be radically changed. I, along with the guidance of mechanical,
								biomedical, and electrical
								engineers, brought to the manufacturing floor two new pieces of automated equipment. The
								first piece of equipment -- the ball-tipping machine which produced a protective
								covering
								over microcatheter ends with heated suture entities -- reduced the usual operational
								time by
								67%. It manipulated a linear actuator, a heating element, and a control box for the
								operator. My job with this machine was to create the software under a very limited
								memory
								constraint. The second machine, the outer-diameter measuring equipment, reduced
								measuring
								times of catheters by approximately 60%. It manipulated a linear actuator, a dual-axis
								micrometer, and an operator-controlled control box. This code was originally authored
								prior
								to my internship, but I made modifications to ensure its functionality.</p>

							<p><b>Project Oriented:</b> As of September 2019, Cerenovus has been undergoing the
								transition of legal entities
								from Codman to Cerenovus. Part of this process involves rigorous regulatory,
								manufacturing, marketing, and labeling checks to ensure that products and documents are
								updated by a certain date. My role as the Documentation Workstream Lead within the
								Rebranding Project included heading the workstream to update all external and internal
								documents. Beyond this role, I worked as a multi-site point of contact to coordinate the
								release of updated subassemblies, labels, ID bands, and finished goods.</p>

						<!-- GROWING UP SECTION-->
						<h5 class="card-title text-dark">Growing Up</h5>
						<p>Born and raised in Parkland, Florida, a verdant suburb of Deerfield and Fort Lauderdale
							Beach, I have always been one to be outdoors. Soccer, football, basketball, baseball,
							lacrosse, surfing -- there aren't many sports that I wasn't playing in my adolescent years,
							and it
							truly shaped my lifestyle today. In school, I was also someone who truly prided himself in
							reading as many books as possible, and I often spent entire nights under a reading light.
							Eventually, I developed a great passion for Mathematics, to the point that I strongly
							considered a career in it post high-school.</p>
						<!-- ADULT LIFE SECTION -->
						<h5 class="card-title text-dark">Adult Life</h5>
						<p>During high-school I definitely got a glimpse of the mathematical side that I had always
							loved, and I spent the first two years working hard to master it. Days prior to the start of
							my Junior year of highschool, I moved to El Tigre, Anzoategui,
							Venezuela. This drastic transition is likely the most influential moment of the later part
							of my life. There, I had learned about the value of heritage, culture, family, and
							community. It also taught me about the hardwork that is necessary to succeed, after seeing
							so many people struggle to feed themselves in the disaster-ridden country. Moving back to
							the United States pushed me to look for a raison d'être. I had thought Mathematics, Physics,
							or Engineering could be good fits, but I eventually settled on the latter upon reaching
							Notre Dame. I chose the path of Computer Science, and I haven't looked back. I now spend
							many of my days reading about different CS topics or about entrepreneurs in the field. There
							have been countless nights of brainstorming, planning, and implementing, and it has all been
							worth it.</p>
